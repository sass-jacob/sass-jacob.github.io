# Introduction and Purpose
Hello! My name is Jacob and I'm excited to share different things that I get to learn every day. I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in Chemical Engineering at MIT. This site will be used to share small things that I get to do and (hopefully) big things as well. I'll also link some references I think are interesting.

## Interests
I've recently made a change from polymer chemistry/physics to hybrid (mechanistic/ML) modeling of batteries. I have a deep interest in numerical methods for solving PDEs and think we can (try to) learn (some aspects of) battery degradation physics with smart implementations of ML with symbolic regression. It is most important to me to have computationally feasible methods of doing so. We will see.

Outside of that, I enjoy climbing, reading books about math history, learning about the brain, and good burritos.
