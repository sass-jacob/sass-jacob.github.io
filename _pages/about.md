Hello! My name is Jacob and I'm excited to share different things that I get to learn every day. I am currently a 4th year PhD student in Chemical Engineering at MIT. This site will be used to share small things that I get to do and (hopefully) the 'big' things as well. I'll also link some references I think are interesting and fun.
